        <p>
          I’m a Frontend Developer focused on creating clean, accessible, and performant websites. I love learning, experimenting, and turning ideas into real projects. Whether it’s React, Astro, or server-side tinkering, I approach code the same way I approached science: with curiosity, discipline, and care.
